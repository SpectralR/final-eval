Drums'N'Sticks

**CRUD**

Qu'est ce qu'un CRUD?

**First Page**

I hope that as a musician, you know your musical scale

**Database**

everything is working fine, the categories to items is a many to many relationship with an intermediate table, and the items to prices is a one to many relationship ( had to do one si it's this one, but in real life it would have been in the same table for practical issues)

**Ranks**

Only Admin and Shopkeeper ranks are able to go to the add, update and delete Page

**Issues Encountered**

I had issues at first to figure out correctly my database architecture, so had to begin anew, but otherwise everything went as smooth as possible!

**Users**

admin@gmail.com pass: 0000 rank: Admin
m@gmail.com pass: 1111 rank: Shopkeeper
j@gmail.com pass: secret rank: Customer
